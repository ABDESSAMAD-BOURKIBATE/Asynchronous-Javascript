Daily Challenge - Node.js File Operations
==========================================

Welcome to the Node.js Daily Challenge!

This file demonstrates file reading operations using the built-in 'fs' module.

📚 What you're learning:
- File system operations in Node.js
- Reading file contents using fs.readFile() and fs.readFileSync()
- Error handling for file operations
- Integration with custom modules

🎯 Learning Objectives:
1. Understanding the fs (file system) module
2. Asynchronous vs synchronous file operations
3. Proper error handling in file operations
4. Module integration and reusability

📝 File Content Examples:
- This text file contains various types of content
- Numbers: 123, 456.789, -42
- Special characters: @#$%^&*()
- Unicode: 🚀 🎉 📁 💻 ⭐
- Multiple lines and paragraphs

🌟 Node.js Features Demonstrated:
- Built-in modules (fs, path)
- Custom module creation and exports
- NPM package integration (chalk for colors)
- Error handling and validation
- File encoding and character sets

⚡ Performance Notes:
- Synchronous operations block the event loop
- Asynchronous operations are non-blocking
- Always prefer async operations for better performance
- Handle errors gracefully to prevent crashes
